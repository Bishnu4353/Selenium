
Cucumber:
========

Pre-Defined Frameworks
	JUnit----> (TDD--> Test driven framework)
	TestNg--> (TDD--> Test driven framework)
	Cucumber---> (BDD---> Behaviour driven framework)
User-Defined Frameworks
	Data driven 
	Keyword driven
	Hybrid

Installing Cucumber plug-in for Eclipse:

Eclipse Market Place --> search cucumber ---> install
	                  --> search natural ---> install

create a maven project--add dependendies in pom.xml file
create a Features folder in project 
create the feature file--> right click on Features Folder and select file --> give the name --> extention sholud be .features --> finish


Feature File:

Feature File contains all the features of application
	Application : Stock Accounting
	  	Features:
			login---> steps
			supplier creation--->steps
			stock categories.....
			
To specify the steps in the feature file we need to use special  language called Gherkins
Feature
Scenario
Given
When
Add
Then

For Example:
	Feature: Stock Accounting Login Feature
	Description: This feature will test a login functionality

	Scenario: Login with valid userName and Password
	Given  Open  Browser
	When Enter the url "Https://webapp.qedge.com"
	And Enter Username and password
	And Click on Login
	Then must Login  Successfully 

Given
	pre-condition
When/Add
	steps
Then
	Expected

We have to create stepDefinition package in src/test for Test Scenario
and create a class loginStepDefinitions --for each step we need to write methods

now right click on features file run as cucumber test for getting the methods 
go to console--copy --paste in loginStepDefinitions class

create MyTestRunner package in src/test -->create TestRunner class

no need to write anything in test runner class.

we have to write above the test runner class 
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

import cucumber.api.CucumberOptions;
import cucumber.api.junit.Cucumber;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
		
		features="Features",
		glue="StepDefinitions"
		
		)
